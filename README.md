# Education and Outreach 
We frequently volunteer our time to talk to schools, groups and individual K-12 classes about basic security steps they can take to have a more secure online web presence. 

We’ve talked to elementary students, middle school classes, high school students, adults in local organizations, community leaders and more. We can tailor our discussion to fit the needs of your group while keeping the information easy to understand. 

[Education and Outreach On DefensiveOrigins.com](https://defensiveorigins.com/resources/).

If you’d like us to speak to your organization or group, please [contact us](https://defensiveorigins.com/contact/).
